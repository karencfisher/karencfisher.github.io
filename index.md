# Close Encounters of the Data Kind

For long have people been fascinated with unknown and hidden subjects: UFOs, aliens, ghosts, and other paranormal subjects have captured the imagination of many, over many years, often in waves. In the absence of official or mainstream scientific credence, popular mythologies of suppression and conspiracy have been embraced by many. Rumors, hearsay, and urban myths can become viral, especially in the age of social media. And the motto may well be, as the poster on Fox Mulder's wall in the popular series The X-files declares, "I want to believe."

With such thoughts in mind, I have undertaken, as a beginning student of data science, an exploration of a dataset compiling slightly over a century of UFO sightings as collected by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC).
